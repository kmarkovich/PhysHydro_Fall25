## Course Objective

To explain, diagnose, and predict the physical processes that govern: 1) the spatial and temporal characteristics of water in its various storage reservoirs (terrestrial, atmospheric, oceanic) and 2) the corresponding fluxes of water between these reservoirs. To be able to read and interpret the scientific literature on physical hydrology and to be able to work with modern hydrologic datasets. Topics will include the hydrologic cycle, atmospheric thermodynamics, radiation processes, atmospheric circulation, precipitation and snow processes, unsaturated flow, evapotranspiration, groundwater flow, runoff and streamflow, and watershed modeling.

# Textbook

**Required:** Physical Hydrology 2<sup>nd</sup> Edition, by S. Lawrence Dingman

# Coursework and Participation

## Important Dates

**Exam 1: October 7**

**Fall Break: October 9-10**

**Term Project Due: December 4**

**Final Exam: Week of December 8**

## Procedures for Completing Coursework

The homeworks will be focused on analyzing real-world hydrological data using python and will be assigned approximately once per week, and each assignment will be due the following week. If you miss a homework deadline, you can still do the assignment for 50% credit the following week. No credit will be given if you are more than one week late.

There will be 2 exams, one on **October 7<sup>th</sup>** and a final exam during the week of **December 8**. The first exam will the first half of the semester, while the final exam will be comprehensive.

A term paper on any topic in physical hydrology will be due on **December 4.** Details on the term paper requirements will be provided early in the semester.

If you anticipate a difficulty meeting a deadline, please let me know as soon as you know, preferably at least a week in advance.

Unless otherwise indicated, all work must be submitted online in the class’s Canvas web site. If you have a difficulty using a tool to complete work, notify me as soon as possible.

For students in the undergraduate 4-credit section, the labs meet weekly on Thursdays and is primarily a recitation to be able to work with the TA and your classmates on the homework assignments. All students are welcome to attend the lab for additional assistance with the homeworks.
